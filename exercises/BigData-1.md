The `wordcount_spark.py` program we wrote earlier find the word that is used the most times in the input text. It did this by doing a sum reduction
using the `add` operator. You job is to modify this program using a different kind of reduction in order to count the number of distinct words in 
the input text.

Call your new program `distinct_spark.py` and commit it to the repository you used for Assignment 3.
