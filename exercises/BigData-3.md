There is nothing to stop you combining the `map` operation with the `fold` operation. You can even apply `map` more than once in order
to generate more complex mappings. For *bonus marks*, see if you can work out how to use `map` and `fold` to calculate the average of
the square root of all the numbers from 1 to 1000. i.e the sum of the square roots of all the numbers divided by 1000.

Call your new program `squareroot_spark.py` and commit it to the repository you used for Assignment 3.
