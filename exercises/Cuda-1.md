The following program is the familar computation of the [Mandelbrot set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set).

The program works as follows:
1. First, the `image` array is created with shape (1024, 1536) and initialized with zeros.
2. The `compute_mandel` function is called which assigns a value in the range (-2.0 .. 1.0, -1.0 .. 1.0) to each element of the array.
3. The array is then plotted.

The `compute_mandel` function assigns a value to each element by:
1. First calculating `pixel_size_x` and `pixel_size_y`. These correspond to the smallest value that 
can be represented by each element (or pixel) in the array in the X and Y directions respectively.
2. Iterating over each element of the array, and computing the `mandel` value that corresponds to the element.

The `mandel` function works by testing how rapidly the function `z = z<sup>2</sup> + c` converges or diverges for a given value of `c = (x + yi)`.
The value returned is the number of iterations (up to `max_iters`) it takes for the real and imaginary parts of `z` to reach the value 2 (no value
greater than 2 can be part of the set). Faster divergence will result in a smaller number, slower divergence a larger number. A value within the
set will return `max_iters`.

You are going to modify this program to work on a GPU using CUDA. You're going to use the same `mandel` function, except that for it to be usable
with a CUDA kernel, you need to add the `@cuda.jit(device=True)` decorator. This tells CUDA that `mandel` is a *device function*, which is a function
that can only be executed by a kernel on the device. You also need to add the `@cuda.jit` decorator to the `compute_mandel` function as this is going to 
become the CUDA kernel.

Finally, you need to modify the `compute_mandel` function so that it can be used as a CUDA kernel. Remember that instead of iterating over every
element of the array, your kernel will need to iterate over a smaller block of elements. The kernel will need to obtain the starting `x` and `y` 
coordinates using `cuda.grid()` and then calculate the ending `x` and `y` coordinates by obtaining the size of the block using `gridDim` and `blockDim`. 
Once you have starting and finishing `x` and `y` coordinates, you can compute the mandel value for each element of the block as before. 

The final program should look like this (use `mandelbrot_gpu.py` for the file name):

    '''
    c = complex(x, y)
    z = 0.0j
    for i in range(max_iters):
        z = z*z + c
        if (z.real*z.real + z.imag*z.imag) >= 4:
            return i

    return max_iters

@cuda.jit
def compute_mandel(min_x, max_x, min_y, max_y, image, iters):

    ### YOUR CODE HERE
    
if __name__ == '__main__':
	image = np.zeros((1024, 1536), dtype = np.uint8)
	blockdim = (32, 8)
	griddim = (32, 16)
	
	image_global_mem = cuda.to_device(image)
	compute_mandel[griddim, blockdim](-2.0, 1.0, -1.0, 1.0, image_global_mem, 20) 
	image_global_mem.copy_to_host()
	imshow(image)
	show()
~~~
{: .python}

You need to replace `### YOUR CODE HERE` with your code. In addition, it is *essential* that you replace `YOUR COMMENT HERE` with a comment describing 
how your code works.

When you are satisfied it works correctly, commit `mandelbrot_gpu.py` to the same repository you used in Assignment 3.

Note: don't expect the code to run any faster unless you're running on a real GPU.
