Use your knowledge of Numba to convert the `nbody_opt.py` program you wrote in Assignment 3 into a Numba program. Pay particular attention
to the following:

* Add `@jit` decorators to all funcitons
* Add function signatures to all funcitons

Place the resulting code in a file called `nbody_numba.py` and check that it produces the same results as the original program.

When you are satisfied that your program is working, commit it to the same repository you used in Assignment 3
